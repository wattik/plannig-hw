| ass1          | STRIPS Planning Solver                   | LM-Cut                        | The task is to implement a solver of STRIPS planning tasks based on the state-of-the-art heuristic LM-Cut.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ass3/src/wumpus/agent/          | Planning in Stochastic Environment (MDP) | Monte Carlo Tree Search (UTB) | In a stochastic environment, an agent plans its actions taking into account: randomness in its actions and probabilistic behaviour of adversarial players. In this task a robot is asked to find a policy that helps him to gather as much gold as possible while navigating itself in a grid-world with monsters and dangerous pits. Also, the result of the robot's actions is non-deterministic. |
